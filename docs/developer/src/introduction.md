# GNU social Developer's handbook

The book in your hands was written to teach you
the art of contributing to the GNU social codebase.

It starts by introducing the Modules system and architecture,
then the plugin development process and finally the exciting internals
of GNU social for those looking forward to make the most advanced contributions.

# What you need to dive in

At least a webserver such as [nginx](https://nginx.org/) and a DBMS such as [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/).

Depending on what you want to do, you may want to setup a queues (and caching) system such as [redis](https://redis.io/).

To learn how to set all of that up, you may refer to the [System Administrator's handbook](/administrator).

Understand that this book assumes prior programming knowledge, if that doesn't sound like you, refer to our [study
resources](https://www.gnusocial.rocks/soc/study_resources.html) to get started.
