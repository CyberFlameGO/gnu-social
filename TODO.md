# TODO

Hi! Thank you for your interest in contributing, please refer to
[DOCUMENTATION/DEVELOPERS](https://notabug.org/diogo/gnu-social/src/nightly/DOCUMENTATION/DEVELOPERS)
to learn how you can contribute.

Our roadmap is available in the following Kanban board:
[Kanban Board](https://kanban.diogo.site/?controller=BoardViewController&action=readonly&token=03795efb8138c4e7661a900c234c0df1bc3fc03cdfcda8619cd5d0e666de).

There are more pending tasks/ideas to implement in this
[repo's issues](https://notabug.org/diogo/gnu-social/issues).

So consider the issue tracker to be the full backlog, in the kanban board it's just what the
[development team](https://notabug.org/diogo/gnu-social/src/nightly/CREDITS.md)
is working on.
